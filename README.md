## event-router-service

Event router service routes the events from Bhamni to external system and vice versa.
As of now it supports routing the message from Bahmni to GCP Pub sub.
Configuration has to be provided both as an environment variable and through configuration files.
Note: We expect the message to be received and published in JSON format.

## Packaging
```mvn clean package```

## Prerequisite
    JDK 1.17

## Run Application using below command:

mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-DGCP_PUB_SUB_ENABLED=true -DGCP_PROJECT_ID=<GCP_PROJECT_ID> -DGCP_CREDENTIALS_FILE_LOCATION=<GCP_PUB_SUB_AUTHENTICATION_FILE>.json -DBAHMNI_ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_URL=<BAHMNI_ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_URL> -DBAHMNI_ACTIVEMQ_TO_GCP_ROUTE_ENABLED=true -DBAHMNI_ACTIVEMQ_TO_GCP_FAILED_ROUTE_ENABLED=false -DROUTE_DESCRIPTION_FILE_LOCATION=<ROUTE_DESCRIPTION_FILE_LOCATION>  -DLOGGING_LEVEL=INFO"

example:
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-DGCP_PUB_SUB_ENABLED=true -DGCP_PROJECT_ID=gcp-pubsub-id -DGCP_CREDENTIALS_FILE_LOCATION=/Users/Documents/gcp-pubsub-93eb.json -DBAHMNI_ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_URL=tcp://localhost:61616 -DBAHMNI_ACTIVEMQ_TO_GCP_ROUTE_ENABLED=true -DBAHMNI_ACTIVEMQ_TO_GCP_FAILED_ROUTE_ENABLED=false -DROUTE_DESCRIPTION_FILE_LOCATION=/Users/riteshghiya/Documents/route-descriptions.json -DLOGGING_LEVEL=INFO"
